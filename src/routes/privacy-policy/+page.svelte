				time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy,
				and in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to
				the homepages of our websites or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to
				review the Privacy Policy whenever you interact with us to stay informed about our
				information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. Capitalized terms not

			<p class="text-lg font-bold mt-10">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</p>
			<p class="mt-2 text-base">
				We collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit the Sites, and
				sometimes from third parties. Some of this information may be considered <strong
					>“Personal Information” or “Personal Data”,</strong
				>
				some of which may be considered “sensitive,” under various applicable laws. We consider information
				that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be “Personal Information” (such as
				your name, phone number, email address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses
				and cookie identifiers, as “Personal Information” where required by applicable law. If we combine
				information that we consider to be non-personal with Personal Information, we will treat the
				combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Note that we may de-identify
				or pseudonymize Personal Information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or
				converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a “hash.” We maintain and
				use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable
				law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements.
				We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent
				allowed by applicable law.<br /> <br />
				<strong> INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US.</strong> We collect information you provide directly
				to us. For example, we collect information when you use our websites, shop in our online
				stores, call us on the phone, create an online account, join our subscription and loyalty
				programs, sign up to receive our emails, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, promotion or
				survey, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support,
				apply for a job or otherwise communicate with us. This Site collects information that
				identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could
				reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device. The
				types of Personal Information we may collect include your name, email address, zip code,
				billing address, shipping address, phone number, payment information, product preferences,
				demographic information and any other information you choose to provide. In some cases, we
				may also collect information you provide about others. <br /> <br />
				<strong> INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT.</strong> We automatically collect certain information
				about you when you access or use our websites or transact business with us, including: (i) information
				about your use of our websites, such as the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed,
				your IP address and the referring link through which you accessed our websites; (ii) information
				about the transaction, such as product details and the date and location of the purchase/return;
				and (iii) we may use cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”, and other tracking
				technologies to collect information about you when you interact with our websites or emails,
				including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. We may combine this information
				with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving
				our websites and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our Site are
				popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications
				with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked
				and for other internal business purposes.

			<p class="text-lg font-bold mt-10">SHARING INFORMATION</p>
			<p class="mt-2 text-base">
				We may share information about you as follows: (i) with consultants, third-party service
				providers or other vendors who need access to such information to carry out work on our
				behalf, such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment and
				delivery, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service,
				email delivery, auditing, or other services; (ii) in response to a request for information
				if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal
				process or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; (iii) if we
				believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect
				the rights, property and safety of us or any third party; (iv) in connection with, or during
				negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or transfer of all or a
				portion of our business to another company; or (v) with your consent or at your direction.
				We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used
